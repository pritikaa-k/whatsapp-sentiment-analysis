For the dataset use the built in feature present in whatsapp to extract the chats in a text format from any group to visualise the sentiment analysis of that group.

1. Open the WhatsApp application on your device.
2. Navigate to the group chat from which you want to extract the chat history.
3. Once inside the group chat, click on the three-dot menu (â‹®) in the top-right corner.
4. Look for an option like "More" or "Group info," and click on it. Different WhatsApp versions may have slightly different options or placements, so explore the menu for more options if needed.
5. Within the "More" or "Group info" section, check if there is an option to export or send chat history.
6. If an export option is available, click on it, and you may be prompted to choose whether to export the chat with or without media (images, videos, etc.).
7. Select your preferred option, and the chat history will be prepared for exporting.
8. You may then be able to choose where you want to send the chat history, such as via email, cloud storage, or other messaging apps.

After getting the group chat as a text file you can read that file to visulaise it in the R program.
